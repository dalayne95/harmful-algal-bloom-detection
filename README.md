# Detecting Algal Blooms

Phytoplankton are single-celled algae that live in freshwater, saltwater, and everywhere in between. Algal blooms, big explosions of phytoplankton growth, happen naturally every late spring and early fall all around the globe when the water is warm, calm, and there is enough nutrients to go around and encourage growth. Sometimes, blooms grow out of control for a variety of reasons: excess of nutrient from land-based runoff, influx of freshwater, higher than normal temperatures. These are called Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). HABs pose a threat to human health and ecosystem health. They can produce toxins that cause paralysis, irritate lungs and eyes, and kill fish. 

Early detection of algal blooms helps scientists and local officials make public and ecological health decisions before they become a problem with minimal human interventions. Scientists can sample blooms as soon as possible to determine if they are toxic, and make important decisions regarding public health: 
  - beach closures
  - fisherman warnings 
  - seafood warnings  
  
My goal with this project is to create a model using a Convolutional Neural Network that classifies algal blooms using publicly available imagery obtained from Google. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a kind of deep learning algorithm consisting of alternating **convolution** and **pooling** layers resulting in a fully connected layer. The **convolution layers** are what allows a CNN to detect patterns in images. Algal blooms come in all different shapes, sizes and colors, and this highly varied dataset will hopefully lead to a model that is able to classify algal blooms in all forms.
